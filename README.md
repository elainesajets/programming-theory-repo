# 🎮 Programming Theory Project

This is the final project of the **Unity Junior Programmer Pathway**.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

**Main Focus:**  
Apply and demonstrate the four fundamental OOP concepts in Unity:

1. **Abstraction** – Use higher-level methods to hide unnecessary details.
2. **Inheritance** – Create parent/child classes to share and extend functionality.
3. **Polymorphism** – Show method overriding or overloading in action.
4. **Encapsulation** – Use getters and setters to safely expose private data.
